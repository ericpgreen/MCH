# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## How can we contact you?

Posting to Facebook is almost always the best option for asking a class-related question. I'm likely to reply quickly because everyone benefits from the post. If you need a quick answer to something that does not impact others, call or text. Otherwise, send an email.

## What are your office hours?

Office hours vary by week. It's best just to let me know you want to meet and we will find a time that works. Skype is always an option if we can't meet in person.

## Is it OK to record class sessions?

You should feel free to create recordings in class that aid your learning. This does not give you permission to share or distribute these recordings. Know that for all of your classes, the speaker holds the copyright to the lecture, and you must get the speaker’s written permission to distribute this content. And you have to consider individual privacy rights of your classmates.[ This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbA7AGOTlCg) produced by Duke’s Scholarly Communications Office gives a short overview of the issues.

## May I use electronic devices during class?

You are free to use any device in the classroom that helps you learn and work (e.g., laptop, tablet, smartphone). If you try to multitask and work on non-class assignments, improve your high score on Angry Birds Candy Crush, or make a critical trade for your Fantasy Football team, your grade will likely suffer. I will notice, and recent research ([Wood et al., 2012](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131511002077)) suggests that you might not perform as well as you could have in the course if you were not distracted during class.

Rather than banning devices and the internet from the classroom, I will leave it up to you to learn how to use these tools effectively. You will have these distractions in every work meeting once you graduate, so I see no need to enforce an outright ban. Furthermore, I think you will benefit from being able to search the web and use online collaboration tools during class.

That said, I reserve the right to ask you to turn off your device or go offline if I believe that you are distracted or are somehow distracting others (the person behind you will inevitably want to see the[ sneezing panda](http://youtu.be/FzRH3iTQPrk)). Students in one recent study rated other students’ laptop usage as having the most (negative) impact on their ability to concentrate and learn ([Fried, 2008](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131506001436)). I will know if you are wandering the internet. You might not think so, but you make a face that says "I am checking my Facebook News Feed or chatting with someone right now".

No phone calls, texting, instant messaging, or emailing during class. We'll take a break every half hour, so please plan accordingly.

## How do I get the readings?

Duke students have access to all resources. Just follow the links. Items marked as "gated" are only available to students enrolled in this class (and to others via Library reserves).
