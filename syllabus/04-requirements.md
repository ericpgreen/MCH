# COURSE REQUIREMENTS

## Class Participation (50%)

Your participation grade will be determined by your attendance and contributions to class activities. You should be prepared to comment on every reading in case I decide to call on you in class. I will incorporate pop quizzes and other assignments if I feel there is a need to further incentivize students to keep up with the readings.

You are permitted 1 unexcused absence throughout the semester (classes are 2-in-1). Beyond that, each unexcused absence will result in your grade being lowered by 1-step (e.g., A+ to A). Coming late to class counts as 0.5 unexcused absences. You are responsible for [tracking missed classes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lAJb4ZvvhmnSADSynZRi9ZyDRRbR05XnDH0rkdcbTOk/edit?usp=sharing); all inputs on the honor system.

Officially, Duke permits students to miss work due to absence from class in four circumstances: illness; personal emergencies; religious observance; and varsity athletic participation. Please take a moment to [read](http://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/missing-work-classes) how Duke defines each circumstance. Missed work associated with any other absence is not covered by this policy and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

## Midterm Exams (50%)

The first midterm exam (25%) will cover maternal health, and the second midterm (25%) will cover infant and child health. The exams will be conducted in class on October 6 and November 24. The first one will be a writing exam. The second one will be an oral exam. There will be no final exam.
