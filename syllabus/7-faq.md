# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## How can we contact you?

Aside from talking in person, email is my preferred mode of communication; it helps me to keep track of our conversation. A clear and concise email with "MCH" in the subject line will usually result in a response from me within 24 hours, often sooner. If you have a question or request, please put it toward the top of your message. Come across an interesting link? Feel free to send it along but forgive me if I don’t reply. Better yet, post it to our Facebook group so everyone can benefit. Finally, if you find yourself needing to write more than a few sentences, you should probably just come by for office hours so we can talk in person. I lurk on Twitter and usually have Skype open during the day. Feel free to reach me on either one. I’ll respond if I can. I also own a phone and take advantage of its calling features. Sometimes a quick call can save a lot of time.

## What are your office hours?

W 13:00-16:00 in Trent Hall 238. Other times by appointment (email me). Skype, phone, or in-person meetings are possible.

## Is it OK to record class sessions?

You should feel free to create recordings in class that aid your learning. This does not give you permission to share or distribute these recordings. Know that for all of your classes, the speaker holds the copyright to the lecture, and you must get the speaker’s written permission to distribute this content. And you have to consider individual privacy rights of your classmates.[ This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbA7AGOTlCg) produced by Duke’s Scholarly Communications Office gives a short overview of the issues.

## What happens if I miss class?

Officially, Duke permits students to miss work due to absence from class in four circumstances: illness; personal emergencies; religious observance; and varsity athletic participation. Please take a moment to[ read](http://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/missing-work-classes) how Duke defines each circumstance. Missed work associated with any other absence is not covered by this policy and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. See [here](https://github.com/ericpgreen/MCH#class-participation-50) for the implications of unexcused absences on your participation score.

## May I use electronic devices during class?

You are free to use any device in the classroom that helps you learn and work (e.g., laptop, tablet, smartphone). If you try to multitask and work on non-class assignments, improve your high score on Angry Birds Candy Crush, or make a critical trade for your Fantasy Football team, your grade will likely suffer. I will notice, and recent research ([Wood et al., 2012](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131511002077)) suggests that you might not perform as well as you could have in the course if you were not distracted during class.

Rather than banning devices and the internet from the classroom, I will leave it up to you to learn how to use these tools effectively. You will have these distractions in every work meeting once you graduate, so I see no need to enforce an outright ban. Furthermore, I think you will benefit from being able to search the web and use online collaboration tools during class.

That said, I reserve the right to ask you to turn off your device or go offline if I believe that you are distracted or are somehow distracting others (the person behind you will inevitably want to see the[ sneezing panda](http://youtu.be/FzRH3iTQPrk)). Students in one recent study rated other students’ laptop usage as having the most (negative) impact on their ability to concentrate and learn ([Fried, 2008](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131506001436)). I will know if you are wandering the internet. You might not think so, but you make a face that says "I am checking my Facebook News Feed or chatting with someone right now".

No phone calls, texting, instant messaging, or emailing during class. We'll take a break every half hour, so please plan accordingly.

## How do I get the readings?

Duke students have access to all resources. Just follow the links. Items marked as "gated" are only available to students enrolled in this class (and to others via Library reserves).
