1. Use the [IHME mortality visualization tool](http://viz.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/mortality/) to display data for your two countries. Record the number and type of data sources. See also the [web appendix](http://download.thelancet.com/mmcs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673610605181/mmc1.pdf?id=f1b40765af4fa604:-5309d481:1436e5ad2c9:-4a2c1389127435689) of the Hogan et al. article and search for your countries.

2. Find the original data source.

### Session 2b: The who, when, where, and why of maternal mortality

*In this session we'll move beyond country-level mortality statistics to understand who is most likely to die, the timing of maternal deaths, and where and why these deaths occur. You should come away with a sense that too many women are still dying from preventable causes, even if the situation is improving in many parts of the world.*

#### In-Class Activity: Revisiting history

It’s November 1933. FDR has only been in office for a few months, and the country is gripped by the Great Depression. World War II is just around the corner. A new weekly magazine called "News-Week" hit the newsstands for the first time on February 17. The 32-page magazine cost $0.10. The November 18th issue (Vol II, Issue 16) will feature Hitler on the cover and devote one page to “Science”. You have been asked to write an article for this issue about a new report called [Maternal Mortality in New York City](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015068601072) ([gated](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxn_jkXZ1lxuZG5LSy1YWkVPTEk/edit?usp=sharing)). This report followed a [White House Conference on Child Health and Protection](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015009499040) report published the same year ([gated](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxn_jkXZ1lxuTUpMeVVYdGhsWkU/edit?usp=sharing)). Your editor wants a 300-word article and a figure.

### Session 3b: Health systems and implementation challenges

*But just because we know what works, it does not mean that it’s easy to turn this knowledge into action. We’ll talk about the challenges of "scaling up" efficacious programs, and we'll learn about the health systems in which these programs are embedded. We’ll also consider cost-effectiveness and the hard choices facing policy makers.*

#### In-Class Activity: How many mothers’ lives can we save?

Prior to class, [install Spectrum](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/international-health/centers-and-institutes/institute-for-international-programs/list/spectrum.html) and download the [projection file](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/international-health/centers-and-institutes/institute-for-international-programs/list/projection.html) for your group’s assigned low-income country ([instructions](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/international-health/centers-and-institutes/institute-for-international-programs/_documents/manuals/InstallingLiSt.pdf)). Or plan to use the version we have installed on a virtual machine. Read about the [Safe motherhood module](http://www.policyproject.com/pubs/manuals/SafeMoME.pdf) and think about what decisions you will make as a policymaker charged with eliminating preventable maternal deaths in your country.

## <a name="class4">Class 4: Pregnancy</a>

### Session 4a: Antenatal Care

*Is antenatal care effective? What is the optimal number of ANC visits? In this session we'll discuss the results of an influential multi-center randomized trial of the standard ANC model at the time vs "focused ANC" and follow the research trail through the oughts.*

#### In-Class Activity: Plan a professional meeting about slavery and antenatal care

Imagine that you are an ambitious member of the newly formed American Medical Association living in the Antebellum South. You have decided to organize a professional meeting about antenatal care issues among slaves. You need to line up a keynote speaker and organize five additional talks on current (at the time) research and practice. Please create presentation titles and 80 word summaries for the keynote and five talks. Include in the schedule one "progressive" speaker who might challenge the establishment. The chapter on pregnancy ([gated](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxn_jkXZ1lxuWF9Bem9KZlNjSG8/edit?usp=sharing)) in *Birthing a Slave* by Schwartz, M. J. (2006) will get you started.

### Session 4b: Diseases during pregnancy

*Diseases like HIV, TB, and malaria contribute to indirect maternal deaths. In this session we'll survey recent literature on how these diseases affect pregnant women in low-income countries.*

#### Assigned Readings

## <a name="class5">Class 5: Childbirth</a>

### Session 5a: Childbirth

*The majority of maternal deaths are caused by direct obstetric complications that are hard to predict and require life-saving treatment. Having access to emergency obstetric care can mean the difference between life and death when there are complications. That said, most women do not have complications and do not want to deliver at a facility where the quality of care may be questionable (**[prime example*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pev4r1C16-0)*). In this session we'll review the evidence for emergency obstetric care and consider the reasons why facility deliveries are not common in all places.*

#### <a name="ir">In-Class Activity: Innovation review</a>

In 2011, USAID and partners launched the first "grand challenge" for maternal and child health called “[Saving Lives at Birth](http://savinglivesatbirth.net/)”.  The same year, the WHO Innovation Working Group published a thematic report on maternal and child health innovation entitled “[Innovating for Every Woman, Every Child](http://www.who.int/pmnch/activities/jointactionplan/innovation_report_lowres_20110830.pdf)”. Since then, a number of great resources for MCH innovation have been developed, including the [Center for Health Market Innovations](http://healthmarketinnovations.org/) and [Maternova](http://maternova.net/). Peruse resources like these and identify one promising safe motherhood innovation to share with the class.

### Session 5b: Maternal health financing

*Is money what is stopping women from using maternal health services? Should health systems abolish fees for maternity care? Should this care be subsidized? In this session, we'll consider the impact of user fees and demand-side interventions on the use of maternal health services.*

#### Assigned Readings

#### In-Class Activity: Research design

In 2013, Kenya abolished fees for maternity care. How could we study the impact of this decision now? If you could go back in time and advise the Ministry of Health prior to implementation this policy change, how would you have suggested that they roll out the change to maximize learning opportunities?

## <a name="class8">Class 8: Fetal and Neonatal Mortality</a>

### Session 8a: Data and measurement

*In this session we'll look at the data on preterm births, stillbirths, and neonatal mortality. As you read, take note of how each is defined and measured. As we observed in the section on maternal mortality, solid numbers are hard to come by in many countries—especially in the case of stillbirths—so we rely on modeling techniques to estimate. We only have time to scratch the surface, so interested readers might want to check out the Lancet Series on [stillbirths](http://www.thelancet.com/series/stillbirth), [neonatal survival](http://www.thelancet.com/series/neonatal-survival), and [preterm birth](http://www.thelancet.com/series/preterm-birth) to learn more. For older papers, I recommend searching for the titles in Google Scholar and following the "Cited by" links to find more recent work that builds on articles in the collections.*

#### In-Class Activity: Data exploration
In 1729, Jane Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's sister, gave birth to her first child. This child, a boy, Josiah Mecom, died a few weeks before his first birthday. Twenty-two years later, at the age of 39, Jane gave birth to her 12th child, a girl she named Abiah. Almost 9 months later, Abiah was dead. 

How does Jane's experience compare to modern times? We'll fire up R again to look at fertility and infant mortality over time and across countries.

### Session 8b: Interventions

*With a good foundation in the scope of the problem, we can shift our focus to potential solutions and implementation challenges. What is "Kangaroo mother care", and what is the evidence for its efficacy? What does syphilis detection and treatment have to do with stillbirths? How many deaths could be averted by scaling up proven interventions to full coverage?*

#### In-Class Activity: The Oregon Trail
In 1989 I spent a summer at computer camp playing [Oregon Trail](http://www.oregontrail.com/hmh/site/oregontrail/) nonstop on the Apple IIGS. The game takes place in the mid-1800s during the Westward Expansion as nearly a half a million people in the U.S. made the [arduious 2,000 mile trip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Trail) from east to west by wagon wheel, often falling victim to cholera, hypothermia, and botched attempts to ford the river. 

Now it's your turn to try your hand at the game and investigate child injuries and mortality at the same time. Before class, visit this [page](http://www.virtualapple.org/oregontraildisk.html) using the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) browser and install the plugin that will allow you to run the Apple II emulator. And get your 1989 playlist ready. Paula Abdul's "Straight Up" and Bobby Brown's "My Prerogative" are just some of the hits that topped the charts in 1989. Please, no Debbie Gibson.  

In class, we'll assign students to different player profiles to see if money buys health: 

1. A banker from Boston
2. A carpenter from Ohio
3. A farmer from Illinois

Name your players as follows: 

1. Bert (adult male)
2. Bertha (adult female)
3. Jimmy (4 year old boy)
4. Laura (2 year old girl)
5. Ruth (1 month old girl)

We'll also assign departure months. Leave too early and your oxen might starve because the grass is not ready. Leave too late and you won't make it before winter.

Spend your money as you see fit, but keep track of your itemized bill. Once you set off, you will get regular status reports. Record the date, variables such as health, and your game decisions. Keep track of who dies, when, and from what cause. Track injuries as well. A spreadsheet will be provided.

### Session 9b: Interventions

*What "works", and how many under-5 lives could be saved if proven interventions reached those in need? Get the feeling we should just keep repeating "Implementation. Implementation. Implementation."?*

#### Assigned Readings

## <a name="class12">Class 12: Mental Health and Development</a>

### Session 11a: Maternal mental health

*A growing area of research is maternal mental health and the impact of a mother’s ill health on fetal, infant, and child development. Pregnant women and mothers with poor mental health are less likely to care for their own needs and the needs of their infants; are more likely to forgo antenatal and postnatal care, deviate from health regimens, and have poor physical health outcomes; and are at elevated risk for alcohol and substance abuse. Children of depressed mothers are more likely to be stunted and underweight, sick, developmentally delayed, poorly attached, and exhibit cognitive and emotional delays. In this session, we'll explore the problem of perinatal depression and evidence of treatment efficacy in low-resource settings.*

### Session 12b: Child development

*The first 1,000 days—from conception until a child’s second birthday—lay the foundation for a healthy and productive life. Newborns who survive their first month of life are 30 days into the most rapid period of human development—early childhood. Children are most likely to thrive in their early years—and into adulthood—if they are born healthy and into a nurturing environment. Prenatal insults, birth-related complications, or early environments that cause infants to be malnourished, sick, or deprived of stimulation, can negatively impact brain development and future learning ability. Compared to their healthy peers, children with cognitive and emotional deficits spend less time in school and earn 20 percent less money in their adult years, which has implications for the individual, her family, and society. In this session we'll discuss the importance of early childhood development and how to help all children reach their potential.*

> In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children...studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, form more stable families of their own.  We know this works.  So let’s do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind.
