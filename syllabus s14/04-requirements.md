# COURSE REQUIREMENTS

## Class Participation (50%)

I expect that all students will make regular, meaningful contributions to class discussions and team assignments. For that reason, your participation grade will be determined by your attendance and contributions to class activities. Every class I will pull a few names at random to determine who will be the first to field questions about the required readings. If you are absent on the day I pull your name, you will lose 3 participation points (excused absences excluded). If this happens twice, your grade will drop a step (e.g., from A+ to A).

## Writing Assignments (50%)

The first midterm exam (40%) will cover maternal health, and the second midterm (40%) will cover infant and child health. Both exams will be take-home. I will announce details about the first midterm exam on Feb 24, and you will have until 9am ET on Mar 4 to submit it. Iâ€™ll give you details about your second midterm on the last day of class, and it will be due at 9am ET on April 22. I will give other small writing assignments throughout the semester that will make up 20% of your "writing assignments" grade.

I encourage you to consult the Writing Studio throughout the semester. You may seek their support for any assignment, including the midterm exams. The Writing Studio also publishes [helpful resources](http://twp.duke.edu/writing-studio/resources) that will help you to improve your drafts, such as [this collection](http://twp.duke.edu/writing-studio/resources/working-with-sources) on working with sources. Avoid plagiarism and [know when to quote (rarely) and when to paraphrase (often)](http://twp.duke.edu/uploads/media_items/quotations.original.pdf). If you do not use a citation manager, you should, and the library can help you get started.
